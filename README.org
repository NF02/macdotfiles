 My Mac Os developing config
 
** Software used
To be sure that everything works I decided to publish the list of software I use to develop on Mac Os X
- *Emacs* - I use it to write in LaTeX and also to program medium complexity projects
- *iterm2* - one of the best terminal emulators available on Mac Os, obviously this is also an open source
- *docker* - container manager
- *resize master* - an application I use to scale images before uploading them online
- *Clipy* - to manage the system clipboard, this thing allows me to replicate the layouts I use under Linux with clipman
- *Eclipse* - for complex projects in Java
- *homebrew* - package manager that yields bsd compatibility
- *Mactex* - LaTeX distribution for Mac Os X
